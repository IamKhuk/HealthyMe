        'Glasses may also help to straighten a squint, and in some cases can fix the lazy eye without the need for further treatment.\nYour child may say they can see better without their glasses. This is because their eyes have become used to working hard to focus and they now find it difficult to let the glasses focus for them.\nIn children, most cataracts are removed to allow better development of vision in the affected eye.\nA number of different treatment options can be used to encourage your child to use the affected eye.\nUsing a path involves placing a patch with a sticky rim over the "good" eye so the lazy eye is forced to work. It can be very effective in improving the sight in the lazy eye. Patches often need to be worn with glasses.\nAtropine eyedrops can be used to blur the vision in the good eye. They expand (dilate) the pupil of the good eye and blur vision, which encourages the child to use the lazy eye.\nIn some cases, a lazy eye does not improve despite having proper treatment. Sometimes poor results are due to the child or family finding it difficult to stick to using the patch or the eyedrops. If you\'re having trouble with one kind of treatment, discuss the alternatives with your eye specialist.',
